## Dockerfile Basics
Before we construct our Dockerfile, you need to understand what makes up the file. This will be a text file, named Dockerfile, that includes specific keywords that dictate how to build a specific image. The specific keywords you can use in a file are:
- FROM
- ADD
- EXPOSE
- RUN
- WORKDIR
- COPY 
- VOLUME
- ENV
- ARG


- CMD
- ENTRYPOINT 

RUN
